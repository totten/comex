# extpub: Extension Publisher (Proof of Concept)

`extpub` is a system for publishing CiviCRM extensions as `composer` packages.

Extensions from the `civicrm.org` extension directory are automatically scanned. Each tagged version
is published as a `composer` package in the format `cxt/<key>` (e.g. `cxt/org.civicrm.flexmailer`).
